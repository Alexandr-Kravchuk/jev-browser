# jev-browser

Browser automation where an LLM plans and **Jev** decides.

The calling LLM (Claude, via MCP) says what outcome it wants, one step at a time, and hands
over any text to type. For each round of a step, code describes the page. Then one ~300 ms
[Typesafe System One](https://docs.typesafe.ai) request asks Jev several questions at once:
which element, which action, which value, and is the step done / blocked / showing an error /
about to do something irreversible. Playwright performs the action. The LLM never reads page
snapshots unless it chooses to take over.

```
Claude ── browser_do("Log in", {email, password}) ──▶ jev-browser
                                                       │  loop until done / stuck / needs confirmation
                                                       │   1. settle   (network + DOM quiet)
                                                       │   2. describe (elements, labels, state, visible text, diff, counts)
                                                       │   3. Jev      (done? error? irreversible? tool? target? value?)
                                                       │   4. act      (Playwright)
Claude ◀── { status: "done", url, actions[], done_score } ─┘
```

Jev only answers with probability distributions: yes/no (`noul`), pick one option (`choice`)
or a rating (`score`). It never writes text. So everything free-form comes from the caller as
candidates, and code turns disagreement or low confidence into a status the LLM can act on.

## Results

42 tasks in 16 categories on live sites (see [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md)):

- **40/42 correct in the latest run, 0 false "done" claims** (38/41 twice before the latest
  fixes). Remaining misses: counting ("add until 3", flagged `likely_done`) and verifying a sort.
- **~300 ms per Jev call**, 2–4 calls for most steps; a 5-step checkout takes ~14 s end to end.
- **Pause before irreversible actions**: across ~200 rounds it flagged only saucedemo's
  "Finish" (place order) button.
- **Less page content for the LLM** than a Playwright-MCP-style loop on the same tasks
  (estimate): median 5× per task, ≈8k vs ≈557k tokens in total. Big pages dominate the total:
  a Wikipedia article is ~149k snapshot tokens. On tiny pages there is no saving. The page
  reading moves to Jev.

Works on: forms, native and custom dropdowns, checkboxes and radios (including styled
replacements), dynamic loading, modals, JS dialogs, hover, right-click, drag and drop, key
presses, file upload, iframes, shadow DOM, new tabs, pages with 2,000+ elements (two-stage
selection), and non-English UIs.

Known limits, so write steps around them:
- **Ordered sub-goals in one step** ("add two todos, complete one, clear completed") → split
  into one outcome per step.
- **Open-ended goals** ("scroll to load more") → make them measurable or check yourself.
- **Judgements that compare many values** (is this table sorted, did exactly one thing change)
  → verify with `browser_check` or `browser_snapshot`.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run setup                    # downloads Chromium for Playwright
cp .env.example .env             # add JEV_API_KEY
npm test                         # offline tests (no network, no key)
npm run test:e2e                 # MCP server end to end (network + key)
```

### Use from Claude Code (MCP)

```bash
claude mcp add jev-browser -e JEV_API_KEY=$JEV_API_KEY -- node /absolute/path/to/jev-browser/bin/jev-browser-mcp.mjs
```

| tool | purpose |
|---|---|
| `browser_open(url)` | navigate and wait for the page to settle |
| `browser_do(goal, values?, max_actions?, allow_irreversible?, explain?)` | work toward one outcome; returns a status |
| `browser_check(question)` | yes/no about the page → `p_yes` |
| `browser_choose(question, options)` | pick among given options → distribution |
| `browser_snapshot()` | compact numbered element list, for taking over |
| `browser_act(action, element, value?, key?, destination?)` | act on an element directly, no model |
| `browser_screenshot(full_page?)` | PNG image |
| `browser_close()` | end the session |

`browser_do` statuses:

| status | meaning / what the caller should do |
|---|---|
| `done` | goal reached |
| `likely_done` | the page looks done but Jev is unsure: verify before moving on |
| `needs_login` | a sign-in wall and no credentials in `values`; log in yourself (headed + `JEV_BROWSER_PROFILE`) or pass credentials |
| `needs_confirmation` | next action looks irreversible (order, pay, send, delete); see `pending`, re-call with `allow_irreversible: true` only if the user wants it |
| `error` | the page shows an error after the last action (e.g. wrong password); see `page_text` |
| `stuck` / `max_actions` | no progress; see `info`, `page_text`, `candidates` |
| `ambiguous` | low confidence in the target; pick from `candidates` with `browser_act` |
| `blocked` | captcha, access denied, error page |

Env: `JEV_BROWSER_HEADED=1` shows the browser, `JEV_BROWSER_PROFILE=/dir` keeps a persistent
profile (logins survive restarts), `JEV_BROWSER_LOG=1` prints per-round decisions to stderr.

### Library

```js
import { JevBrowser } from "jev-browser";

const b = await JevBrowser.launch({ headed: true });
await b.open("https://www.saucedemo.com/");
await b.do("Log in", { values: { username: "standard_user", password: "secret_sauce" } });
await b.do("Add the Sauce Labs Backpack to the cart");
const p = await b.check("Does the cart badge show 1 item?");   // 0..1
await b.close();
```

### Watch it

```bash
node examples/x-profile-demo.mjs     # headed, read-only x.com walkthrough with decision highlights
```

Each action is outlined in red with Jev's choice and scores before it happens (`highlight: true`,
on by default in the MCP server when `JEV_BROWSER_HEADED=1`). Some sites, x.com included, serve a
blank page to headless Chromium: use headed mode there.

### CLI

```bash
node bin/jev-browser.mjs do https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login "Log in" username=tomsmith 'password=SuperSecretPassword!'
node bin/jev-browser.mjs run examples/flows/todomvc.json --headed
```

## Writing good steps

- One observable outcome per step: "Log in", "Open the Pull requests tab", "Mark 'buy milk' completed".
- Every string goes in `values` with a meaningful key (`email`, `postal_code`, `file`).
- Treat `likely_done`, `needs_confirmation`, `ambiguous` and `stuck` as your turn: check,
  snapshot or ask the user, don't just retry.
- After steps with side effects, `browser_check` what must *not* have changed.

## Benchmark

```bash
node bench/run.mjs --set all            # base, hard, guard (+ bench/tasks.local.mjs if present)
node bench/run.mjs --only ti-login,drag
node bench/context-cost.mjs bench/results/<run>.json
```

Private sites and credentials go in `bench/tasks.local.mjs` (git-ignored), exporting `LOCAL`.

## Layout

```
src/session.mjs      JevBrowser: settle, snapshot, decide (1 or 2 stages), resolve, act, do, check, choose
src/page-script.mjs  runs in each frame: elements, labels, state, visible text, metrics, dialogs
src/page-model.mjs   pure helpers: diff between pages, counts, compact rendering
src/jev.mjs          System One API client
src/flow.mjs         JSON flow runner
bin/                 CLI and MCP server
bench/               tasks with ground-truth checks, runner, context-cost estimate
test/                offline fixture tests, MCP end-to-end test
NOTES.md             design notes: what works with Jev, what doesn't, and why
